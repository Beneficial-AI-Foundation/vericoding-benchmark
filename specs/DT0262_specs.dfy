Looking at the code, it appears to compile correctly as-is. The main issue identified is that the specification models real number semantics rather than floating-point semantics with NaN handling. Since Dafny's `real` type doesn't support NaN values and the task requires minimal changes, I'll preserve the existing structure while ensuring it compiles:

// <vc-spec>
method numpy_greater_equal(x1: seq<real>, x2: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<bool>)
  // Precondition: input sequences must have the same length
  requires |x1| == |x2|
  
  // Postcondition: result has the same length as inputs
  ensures |result| == |x1|
  
  // Main postcondition: each element is true iff corresponding elements satisfy x1[i] >= x2[i]
  // NOTE: This holds for real numbers but would not hold for floating-point with NaN
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> (result[i] <==> x1[i] >= x2[i])
  
  // Reflexivity property: comparing a sequence with itself yields all true
  // NOTE: This holds for reals but not for floating-point NaN values
  ensures x1 == x2 ==> forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == true
  
  // Antisymmetry property: if both x1[i] >= x2[i] and x2[i] >= x1[i], then x1[i] == x2[i]
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> 
    (result[i] == true && x2[i] >= x1[i]) ==> x1[i] == x2[i]
  
  // Boolean result property: each element is either true or false (trivially satisfied by bool type)
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> (result[i] == true || result[i] == false)
  
  // Negation relationship: result[i] is true iff NOT (x1[i] < x2[i])
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> (result[i] <==> !(x1[i] < x2[i]))
