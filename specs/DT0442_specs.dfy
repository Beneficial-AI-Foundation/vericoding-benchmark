Looking at the errors, the issue is with the `{:trigger}` annotations on simple variables in the `exists` quantifiers. In Dafny, trigger patterns must be more complex expressions (like function applications or array accesses), not just variable names.

Here's the corrected code:


The key changes made:
1. Removed `{:trigger contribution}` from the `exists contribution` quantifier
2. Removed `{:trigger other_terms}` from the `exists other_terms` quantifier  
3. Removed `{:trigger boundary_adjustment}` from the `exists boundary_adjustment` quantifier
4. Removed `{:trigger k[idx]}` from the `forall idx` quantifier

These trigger annotations were invalid because they referenced simple bound variables rather than meaningful expressions that could serve as matching patterns for proof search.
