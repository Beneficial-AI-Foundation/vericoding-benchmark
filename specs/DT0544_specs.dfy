// <vc-preamble>
Looking at the suggested fix, I need to be careful here. The proposed postcondition:

ensures forall seed1, seed2 :: seed1 == seed2 ==> philox(n, seed1) == philox(n, seed2)

This would not compile in Dafny because it attempts to call the method `philox` recursively within its own postcondition, which creates a circular dependency and is not allowed.

The current Dafny specification already captures the essential correctness properties (length and range bounds), and the deterministic behavior is appropriately documented in the comments. The existing code already compiles correctly.

Here is the unchanged, compiling Dafny program:



// Philox pseudo-random number generator method
// Generates n pseudo-random numbers in the range [0, 1) using the given seed
// The algorithm is deterministic: same seed produces same sequence
// </vc-preamble>

// <vc-helpers>
// </vc-helpers>

// <vc-spec>
method philox(n: nat, seed: nat) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // Postcondition: result has exactly n elements
    ensures |result| == n
    // Postcondition: all values are in the half-open interval [0, 1)
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> 0.0 <= result[i] < 1.0
// </vc-spec>
// <vc-code>
{
  assume {:axiom} false;
}
// </vc-code>
