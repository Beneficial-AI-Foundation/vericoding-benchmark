Looking at the issues, the main problem is an overly complex specification that may have logical inconsistencies. Here's a corrected, simplified version that compiles and preserves the core semantics:


The key changes made:
1. Separated the complex conjunction into multiple `ensures` clauses for better readability and logical clarity
2. Simplified the padding constraint to directly specify that padding characters are the fillchar, rather than using existential quantification
3. Removed redundant constraints that were already implied by the core properties
4. Maintained the essential semantics while making the specification more maintainable

method ljust(a: seq<string>, width: nat, fillchar: string) returns (result: seq<string>)
  // Precondition: fillchar must be exactly one character
  requires |fillchar| == 1
  
  // Postcondition: result array has same length as input
  ensures |result| == |a|
  
  // Core mathematical properties of left-justification for each string
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==>
    // Length property: result length is max of original length and width
    |result[i]| == if |a[i]| >= width then |a[i]| else width
  
  // Identity property: strings already >= width are unchanged
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==>
    |a[i]| >= width ==> result[i] == a[i]
  
  // Left-justification property: original string is preserved as prefix when padded
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==>
    |a[i]| < width ==> (
      |result[i]| == width &&
      (forall j :: 0 <= j < |a[i]| ==> result[i][j] == a[i][j]) &&
      (forall k :: |a[i]| <= k < width ==> result[i][k] == fillchar[0])
