/-- Compute the roots of a Chebyshev series.
    
    Returns the roots (zeros) of the polynomial p(x) = Σᵢ c[i] * Tᵢ(x),
    where Tᵢ(x) denotes the i-th Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind.
    
    For a polynomial of degree n (with n+1 coefficients), returns n roots.
    The roots are sorted in ascending order.
    
    Note: While roots may be complex in general, this specification focuses on 
    the real case for simplicity. -/

/-- Specification: chebroots computes all roots of a Chebyshev polynomial series.
    
    The roots satisfy:
    1. Each root r is a zero of the Chebyshev polynomial p(x) = Σᵢ c[i] * Tᵢ(x)
    2. The number of roots equals the degree of the polynomial (n)
    3. The roots are sorted in ascending order
    4. No repeated roots for polynomials with distinct roots (multiplicity 1) -/
