/-- Evaluate a 2-D Chebyshev series at points (x, y).
    
    For a coefficient matrix c of dimensions rows × cols, this computes:
    p(x[k], y[k]) = ∑_{i=0}^{rows-1} ∑_{j=0}^{cols-1} c[i,j] * T_i(x[k]) * T_j(y[k])
    where T_n is the n-th Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind.
    
    The x and y vectors must have the same length, and each pair (x[k], y[k])
    represents a point at which to evaluate the 2D Chebyshev series. -/

/-- Specification: chebval2d correctly evaluates the 2D Chebyshev series.
    
    The result at each point (x[k], y[k]) equals the double sum:
    ∑_{i=0}^{rows-1} ∑_{j=0}^{cols-1} c[i,j] * T_i(x[k]) * T_j(y[k])
    
    Mathematical properties:
    1. Empty coefficient matrix: When rows = 0 or cols = 0, returns zero vector
    2. Constant polynomial: When rows = 1 and cols = 1, returns c[0,0] at all points
    3. Linear separability: For c[i,j] = a[i] * b[j], result[k] = chebval(x[k], a) * chebval(y[k], b)
    4. Symmetry: chebval2d(x, y, c) and chebval2d(y, x, c^T) produce related results
    5. Clenshaw recursion: Implementation should use numerically stable recursion
    
    The specification ensures:
    - Correct evaluation of 2D Chebyshev polynomial series
    - Numerical stability through appropriate algorithms
    - Handling of edge cases (empty matrices, single coefficients) -/
