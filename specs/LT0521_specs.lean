/-- Helper function to compute the convolution coefficient at index k.
    
    Returns the sum of all products c1[i] * c2[j] where i + j = k.
    The summation ranges over all valid indices where both i < m+1 and j < n+1.
    
    For polynomial multiplication, when we multiply:
    (c1[0] + c1[1]*x + ... + c1[m]*x^m) * (c2[0] + c2[1]*x + ... + c2[n]*x^n)
    
    The coefficient of x^k in the result is the sum of all c1[i] * c2[j] where i + j = k.
    This is exactly the discrete convolution formula.

/-- Multiply one polynomial by another.
    
    Given two polynomials represented as vectors of coefficients from lowest to highest degree,
    returns their product as a vector of coefficients.
    
    For polynomials p1(x) = c1[0] + c1[1]*x + ... + c1[m]*x^m
    and p2(x) = c2[0] + c2[1]*x + ... + c2[n]*x^n,
    the product has degree m + n and coefficients given by discrete convolution. -/

/-- Specification: polymul computes the product of two polynomials via convolution.
    
    The coefficient at position k in the result is the sum of all products c1[i] * c2[j]
    where i + j = k. This corresponds to collecting terms of the same degree when
    expanding the product of two polynomials.
    
    Mathematical properties:
    1. Degree: If p1 has degree m and p2 has degree n, then p1*p2 has degree m+n
    2. Constant term: result[0] = c1[0] * c2[0] (product of constant terms)
    3. Highest degree term: result[m+n] = c1[m] * c2[n] (product of leading coefficients)
    4. Convolution: Each coefficient follows the discrete convolution formula
    5. Commutativity: polymul c1 c2 = polymul c2 c1 (polynomial multiplication is commutative)
    6. Associativity: polymul (polymul c1 c2) c3 = polymul c1 (polymul c2 c3)
    
    Example: [1,2,3] * [3,2,1] = [3,8,14,8,3]
    This represents (1+2x+3x²)(3+2x+x²) = 3+8x+14x²+8x³+3x⁴
