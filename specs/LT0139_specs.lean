    This function counts business days (weekdays excluding weekends and holidays)
    between pairs of dates. The end date is excluded from the count.
    
    If end date is earlier than begin date, the count is negative.

/-- Specification for busday_count function.
    
    This theorem specifies the key properties of business day counting:
    1. When begin_date = end_date, count is 0
    2. When end_date < begin_date, count is negative
    3. Forward direction gives non-negative count
    4. Holidays are excluded from the count
    
    The specification captures the mathematical properties of business day counting
    as described in the NumPy documentation.
