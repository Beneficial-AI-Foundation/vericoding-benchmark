/-- Evaluate a 3-D Hermite series on the Cartesian product of x, y, and z.
    
    This function evaluates the polynomial:
    p(a,b,c) = ∑_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} * H_i(a) * H_j(b) * H_k(c)
    
    where H_n is the nth Hermite polynomial, and the evaluation points
    (a,b,c) are all combinations from the Cartesian product x × y × z.

/-- Specification for hermgrid3d: evaluates a 3D Hermite polynomial series
    on a Cartesian grid formed by input vectors x, y, and z.
    
    The result is a 3D array where result[a][b][c] contains the evaluation
    of the Hermite polynomial at point (x[a], y[b], z[c]).
    
    Key properties:
    1. The output shape matches the Cartesian product dimensions
    2. Each element is computed as a triple sum over Hermite polynomial terms
    3. The coefficient tensor c[i][j][k] is multiplied by H_i(x) * H_j(y) * H_k(z)
    4. Hermite polynomials follow the physicists' convention
