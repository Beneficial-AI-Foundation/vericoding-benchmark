/-- numpy.less: Return the truth value of (x1 < x2) element-wise.
    
    Performs element-wise comparison between two vectors and returns a boolean
    vector indicating where elements of x1 are less than corresponding elements
    of x2.
    
    This is a fundamental comparison operation used throughout NumPy for
    conditional operations and boolean indexing.

/-- Specification: numpy.less returns a boolean vector where each element
    indicates whether the corresponding element in x1 is less than the
    corresponding element in x2.
    
    Mathematical Properties:
    1. Element-wise comparison: result[i] = x1[i] < x2[i]
    2. Strict ordering: For each index i, exactly one of the following holds:
       - x1[i] < x2[i] (result[i] = true)
       - x1[i] ≥ x2[i] (result[i] = false)
    3. Anti-symmetry: If less(x1, x2)[i] = true, then less(x2, x1)[i] = false
    4. Transitivity property: If less(x1, x2)[i] = true and less(x2, x3)[i] = true,
       then less(x1, x3)[i] = true
    5. Special values: NaN comparisons always return false (IEEE 754 standard)
    6. Irreflexivity: x[i] is never less than itself
    
    Precondition: True (no special preconditions for basic comparison)
    Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = true iff x1[i] < x2[i]
