 * Polynomial multiplication by x operation.
 * This module provides functionality to multiply a polynomial by the independent variable x,
 * effectively shifting all coefficients one position higher and prepending a zero coefficient.

method polymulx(c: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // Input polynomial coefficients ordered from low to high degree
    requires |c| >= 0
    // Output has exactly one more coefficient than input
    ensures |result| == |c| + 1
    // First coefficient of result is always 0 (no constant term after multiplication by x)
    ensures result[0] == 0.0
    // Remaining coefficients are the original coefficients shifted by one position
    // This represents multiplying p(x) by x to get x*p(x)
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |c| ==> result[i + 1] == c[i]
