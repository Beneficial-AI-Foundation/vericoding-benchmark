Looking at the error, the issue is in the postcondition where the `||` operator is being applied incorrectly. The `||` should operate on two boolean expressions, but it's currently trying to operate on a FloatValue and a boolean expression.

Here's the corrected code:



// Floating-point value that can represent NaN
datatype FloatValue = Real(value: real) | NaN

// Vector type represented as a sequence of floating-point values
type Vector = seq<FloatValue>

/**
 * Computes the element-wise minimum of two input vectors.
 * 
 * For each position i, the result contains min(x1[i], x2[i]).
 * If one of the elements being compared is NaN, then that element is returned.
 * Satisfies mathematical properties of commutativity, associativity,
 * and idempotency for the minimum operation.
 */
The key fix was adding parentheses around the boolean expressions in the commutativity postcondition so that the `||` operator operates on two boolean expressions rather than trying to apply it to a FloatValue and a boolean.
