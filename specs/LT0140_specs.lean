May be specified as a length-seven list or array, like [1,1,1,1,1,0,0]; a length-seven string, like '1111100'; or a string like \"Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri\", made up of 3-character abbreviations for weekdays, optionally separated by white space. Valid abbreviations are: Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun\nholidays : array_like of datetime64[D], optional\n    An array of dates to consider as invalid dates. They may be specified in any order, and NaT (not-a-time) dates are ignored. This list is saved in a normalized form that is suited for fast calculations of valid days.\nbusdaycal : busdaycalendar, optional\n    A \`busdaycalendar\` object which specifies the valid days. If this parameter is provided, neither weekmask nor holidays may be provided.\nout : array of datetime64[D], optional\n    If provided, this array is filled with the result.\n\nReturns\n-------\nout : array of datetime64[D]\n    An array with a shape from broadcasting \`\`dates\`\` and \`\`offsets\`\` together, containing the dates with offsets applied.",
