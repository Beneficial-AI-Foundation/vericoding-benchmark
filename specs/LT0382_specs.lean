Computes the coefficients of a Chebyshev series of degree `deg` that is the
least squares fit to the data values `y` given at points `x`.

The fitted polynomial is in the form:
p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * T_1(x) + ... + c_deg * T_deg(x)

where T_k(x) is the k-th Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind.

Specification: chebfit returns coefficients c such that the resulting Chebyshev series
minimizes the sum of squared errors between the original data points and the fitted polynomial.

The specification ensures:
1. The result has deg + 1 coefficients (from degree 0 to deg)
2. The degree must be less than the number of data points (deg < m) for a well-defined problem
3. The coefficients produce a Chebyshev polynomial that best fits the data in the least squares sense
4. The fitting minimizes the sum of squared residuals: Σ(y[i] - p(x[i]))²
   where p(x) is the Chebyshev polynomial with the computed coefficients
5. All x-coordinates must be in the interval [-1, 1] for standard Chebyshev polynomials,
   or the implementation should transform them appropriately
6. The Chebyshev basis provides better numerical conditioning than power series
