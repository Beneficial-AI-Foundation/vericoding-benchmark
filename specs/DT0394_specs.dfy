Looking at the error, there's a warning about a missing trigger for a quantifier. The warning is being treated as an error because `--allow-warnings` was not specified.

Here's the corrected Dafny code with an explicit trigger added to the existential quantifier:

/*
 * Chebyshev points of the second kind.
 * 
 * Generates n Chebyshev points of the second kind, which are the values
 * cos(π*k/(n-1)) for k from 0 to n-1, sorted in ascending order.
 * These points are the extrema and endpoints of the Chebyshev polynomial T_{n-1}.
 */

// Mathematical constants and helper functions for specification
const PI: real := 3.141592653589793

// Cosine function (declared as uninterpreted for specification purposes)
function cos(x: real): real
{
  0.0  // Dummy implementation for compilation
}

// Axioms for cosine function behavior needed for specification
The only change made was adding the explicit trigger `{:trigger cos(PI * k as real / (n - 1) as real)}` to the existential quantifier that was causing the warning. This tells Dafny when to instantiate the quantifier, resolving the compilation issue.
