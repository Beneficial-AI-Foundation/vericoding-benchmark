Calculates which of the given dates are valid business days.
A business day is a day that is both:
1. Allowed by the weekmask (Monday-Friday by default)
2. Not a holiday

Specification: is_busday returns a boolean vector indicating which dates are business days.
A date is a business day if:
1. Its day of week is allowed by the weekmask
2. It is not in the holidays list
