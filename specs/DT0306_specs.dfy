 * Implementation of numpy.divmod: element-wise quotient and remainder computation.
 * 
 * This module provides a specification for computing element-wise division returning
 * both quotient and remainder simultaneously. For each pair of elements (x, y),
 * returns (x // y, x % y) following Python's division semantics with floor division
 * and remainder having the same sign as the divisor.
