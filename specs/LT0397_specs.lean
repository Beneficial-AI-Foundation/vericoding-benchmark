/-- Helper function to compute Chebyshev polynomial T_n(x) recursively -/
def chebyshevT (n : Nat) (x : Float) : Float :=
  match n with
  | 0 => 1
  | 1 => x
  | n + 2 => 2 * x * chebyshevT (n + 1) x - chebyshevT n x

/-- Evaluate a Chebyshev series at points x using coefficients c.
    For a coefficient vector c of length n+1, this computes:
    p(x) = c_0 * T_0(x) + c_1 * T_1(x) + ... + c_n * T_n(x)
    where T_k(x) is the k-th Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind.
    
    The implementation uses Clenshaw recursion for numerical stability. -/

      if k ≥ n + 1 then acc
      else loop (k + 1) (acc + c.get ⟨k, sorry⟩ * chebyshevT k x)
    loop 0 0

/-- Specification: chebval evaluates the Chebyshev series correctly.
    The result at each point x[i] equals the sum of c[k] * T_k(x[i])
    for k from 0 to n-1, where T_k is the k-th Chebyshev polynomial.
    
    Special cases for numerical stability:
    - When n = 0, the result is the zero vector
    - When n = 1, the result is c[0] at each point (constant polynomial)
    - When n = 2, the result is c[0] + c[1] * x[i] (linear polynomial)
    
    The implementation uses Clenshaw recursion for efficient and stable evaluation. -/
