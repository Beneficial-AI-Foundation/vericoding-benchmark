/-- Convert a Hermite series to a polynomial.
    
    Convert a vector representing the coefficients of a Hermite series,
    ordered from lowest degree to highest, to a vector of the coefficients
    of the equivalent polynomial (relative to the "standard" basis) ordered
    from lowest to highest degree. -/

/-- Specification: herme2poly converts Hermite series coefficients to polynomial coefficients.
    
    The function performs a basis transformation from Hermite E polynomials to standard polynomials.
    The transformation preserves the polynomial degree and maintains the coefficient ordering.
    
    For n = 1 or n = 2, the function returns the input unchanged.
    For n > 2, it applies a recurrence relation using the Hermite E polynomial recurrence.
    
    Mathematical properties:
    - Preserves the polynomial degree (same vector length)
    - For single coefficient (n = 1): identity transformation
    - For degree 1 (n = 2): identity transformation  
    - For higher degrees: applies Hermite E to polynomial basis conversion
    - The result represents the same polynomial in standard monomial basis -/
